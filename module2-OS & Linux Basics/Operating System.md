## Introduction to Operating Systems

### Tasks of an Operating System

- Resource Allocation and Management

    - Process management
        - What's a process? small unit that executes on the computer
        - each process has own isolated space

    - Memory Management:
        - allocating working memory
        - every application needs some data to work
        - RAM is limited on the computer
        - Memory Swapping
            - happens when you're out of RAM
            - OS swaps memory between applications
            - on app becomes inactive, new one gets resources
            - swapping slows down your computer

    - Storage Management
        - aka secondary memory
        - persisting data long-term
        - hard drive

- Manage File System
    - Stored in a structured way
    - Unix systems: tree file system

- Management of IO Devices

- Security
    - managing users and permissions
    - each user has its own space
    - each user has permissions

- Networking
    - eg.: ports and IP address


### Operating Systems Components

- Kernel: the heart (or brain) of the operating system

- The kernel is the software who talks with the hardware.


### Standards

- POSIX - Portable Operating Systems
